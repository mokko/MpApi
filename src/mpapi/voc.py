"""
We want to collect methods that deal with vocabulary in a separate class.

First, I want to download vocabulary records in xml
Ideally, I want to get all vocabulary items (= records) that are related to one
set of objects in one go. Only if not possible otherwise, I want to have to download
individual terms.

I want to save all vocabulary items in one file and I want to be able to join records.

I have all the basic code points in MpApi.Client.
